<li>Made it so Thorium can be bundled with assets. This will make it easier to distribute Thorium to donors.</li>
<li>Added training mode! Training mode is shown on single pages at a time. When you start training mode, you see an overlay explaining how different parts of the screen work. Current, Thorium only has training mode for the engine control screen, but more traning is being written and will be released as time goes on.</li>
<li>Various bug and layout fixes</li>
<li>Added the issue tracker back to the Main screen and to the core, so Flight Directors can file issues directly to the Thorium repository</li>
<li>Added the contributors to the bottom of the repository. <a href="https://github.com/Thorium-Sim/thorium#contributors">Check it out!</a> Without these contributors, Thorium would never have gotten to where it is today. If you have contributed in any way and haven&#39;t been recognized, <a href="https://github.com/Thorium-Sim/thorium/issues/new">let me know</a>. And if you are interested in contributing, get in touch! There is a lot to do that doesn&#39;t just involve code.</li>
<li>Changed the targeting grid to use DOM instead of Canvas. This makes it easier to use any kind of image on the targeting grid, same as with the sensors.</li>
<li>Reworked the timeline system. There is a new Core module for the timeline that allows you to preview the timeline and execute timeline steps. Also, timeline step actions have to be pre-defined as components before they can be configured. Currently, only Sensor Presets have been defined in this way, but more are coming.</li>
<li>Improved the asset system to allow for mass-upload of assets.</li>
<li>Improved loading of the core layout. It now selects the simulator if there is only one on a flight, or it makes it more obvious for the flight director to select their simulator.</li>

<p>That&#39;s right. Everything in Thorium is now Libre, which means you can do whatever you want with it. Make your own controls, contribute back, run your own simulator - the sky is the limits. Actually, the sky is no longer the limits, since you have your own starship!</p>
<p>Thorium now supports a donation model. By becoming a donor, you get access to a drop-in built version of Thorium. <a href="https://thoriumsim.com/download/">Consider becoming a donor.</a></p>
<p>As far as upates go:</p>
<ul>
<li>Released the new site. Check it out, and feel free to donate.</li>
<li>Updated package dependencies.</li>
<li>Refactored a lot of the code to simplify and clean it up.</li>
<li>Created a simple viewscreen module. You can now show stuff on a dedicated viewscreen client. There are a lot of opportunities for budding programmers to create screens for the viewscreen. Get in touch if you are interested.</li>
<li>Started working on improvements to the timeline system</li>
<li>Added a na√Øve auto-save feature. It takes a snapshot of the simulator state every 10 seconds. There is no support for going back to specifc saves or rewinding currently, but that feature is planned for the future.</li>

<li>Refactored the sensors system to use a DOM based rendering as opposed to a Canvas based or ThreeJS based rendering. It&#39;s more straightforward and seems to work just fine. The code for both of the other rendering methods is still in the repo, so it can be reused easily.</li>
<li>Switched to using the Jest testing framework. It executes tests faster and provides more features than Mocha, which was being used before.</li>

<p>Thorium as a project began in June of 2016. After the partial failure of <a href="https://github.com/infinitedg/flint">Flint</a>, I wanted to develop a set of controls that I could be proud of. Flint had a pie-in-the-sky vision of what was possible. However, in the day-to-day development, that vision didn&#39;t translate well. Ultimately, due to lack of focus and poor developer experience, Flint fell by the wayside.</p>
<p>After a few months of tinkering <a href="https://github.com/alexanderson1993/website-class">with</a> <a href="https://github.com/alexanderson1993/assassin">other</a> <a href="https://github.com/alexanderson1993/crowdfund">projects</a>, and with the encouragement of my brother, I decided the time finally came to start working on the next version of starship simulator controls. This version wouldn&#39;t reach too far... at first. Instead, it would build a platform for developing modular, future-proof controls with the latest web technologies. </p>
<p>Since then, I&#39;ve been developing Thorium, with a goal to keep momentum by writing code at least once every day. This has been while I&#39;ve been employed part time and attending school full time. (Also, I started dating, got engaged, and got married all while Thorium has been under development).</p>
<p>Keep following this blog for more details about where Thorium is now and where it is going. I hope you like what you see. Just know that the best is yet to come.</p>

<h3 id="technical-details">Technical Details</h3>
<p>I was able to leverage what I learned from Flint to propel my development of Thorium. During the first few months of development, I had to decide several things:</p>
<ul>
<li>How should data be stored?</li>
<li>How should state be managed between the client and the server?</li>
<li>How should data be rendered on the client?</li>
<li>Should I build it for one simulator, or for many simulators?</li>
</ul>
<p>Using web technologies was a no-brainer. The velocity and robustness of web development tools is staggering and jumping aboard was obvious. However, which of those tools to use was carefully considered. After playing around with Elixir and the Phoenix framework, I decided that I would write the server in Node.js. While Elixir would provide significant improvements to speed with concurrent processing and the ability to horizontally scale servers, the use case of simulators doesn&#39;t necessarily need the ability to process a million requests a second. Node.js gives familiarity and also convenience as the front-end and back-end are written with the same language.</p>
<p>The front-end was created with React. The community support is unbeatable and the modular nature makes it possible to keep screens and controls separate while importing when necessary.</p>
<p>GraphQL was a late addition to the mix, but a welcome one. It provides the simplest way of sending data to and from the client and server. With its self-documenting API, it&#39;s really easy to see all of the data you can get and send both ways, simplifying the development process substantially. When they released support for subscriptions, I was sold and jumped all in.</p>
<p>The final piece was event sourcing. This is the idea that instead of storing the current state of the simulator, you store every event which brought the simulator to its current state. This has a few benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>A rich stream of data allowing you to see exactly what happened at what point during the mission, which could be useful for analytics.</li>
<li>The ability to rewind events to a point, effectively allowing you to rewind the experience by an arbitrary amount.</li>
<li>A central event store can send and receive events from multiple servers, making it possible to expand the controls horizontally or though a mircoservice architecture. </li>
</ul>
