- Completed the instant messaging system, including messages to groups, such as security, damage, and medical.
- Refactored the bundler system to no longer use Electron. This fixes a lot of problems, and the negative impact is minimal. Instead of running a window, it starts a terminal session. That's about it.
- Added a system for adding notifications to widgets, in this case for messaging.
- Implemented auto-login for stations
- Started working on a Army Contacts timeline macro


That's it for this week. Be sure to file any feature requests on the [Github repo](https://github.com/Thorium-Sim/thorium/issues).
