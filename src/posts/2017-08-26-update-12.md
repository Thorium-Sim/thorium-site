- Ran a test flight on August 19 and collected bugs. This week I fixed all the bugs. The list of bugs is [here](https://github.com/Thorium-Sim/thorium/issues/214)
- Implemented a 'Blackout' station, for computer screens that you want to be blacked out
- Started working on the instant messaging system

That's it for this week. Be sure to file any feature requests on the [Github repo](https://github.com/Thorium-Sim/thorium/issues). You can also download the latest [alpha](https://github.com/Thorium-Sim/thorium/releases) and see the current [roadmap](https://github.com/Thorium-Sim/thorium/projects/2).
