* Fixes for layout, decoding, sensors, assets, shields, sensor contacts, damage reports, and coolant.
* Added thruster required rotation for manual thrusters on core.
* Added Tractor beam card.
* Released Alpha 1.
* Completely rewrote the core layout engine. Instead of draggable boxes, I'm using a grid layout engine with support for tabs. This should improve laying out core components.

That's it for this week. Be sure to file any feature requests on the [Github repo](https://github.com/Thorium-Sim/thorium/issues). You can also download the latest [alpha](https://github.com/Thorium-Sim/thorium/releases) and see the current [roadmap](https://github.com/Thorium-Sim/thorium/projects/2).
