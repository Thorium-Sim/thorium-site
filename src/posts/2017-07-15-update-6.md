* Refactored the sensors system to use a DOM based rendering as opposed to a Canvas based or ThreeJS based rendering. It's more straightforward and seems to work just fine. The code for both of the other rendering methods is still in the repo, so it can be reused easily.
* Switched to using the Jest testing framework. It executes tests faster and provides more features than Mocha, which was being used before.

As an extra note, I'm starting a WebDev Guild. There is an advancement guide available on the [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/alexanderson1993/webdev-guild).

That's it for this week. Be sure to file any feature requests on the [Github repo](https://github.com/Thorium-Sim/thorium/issues). You can also download the latest [alpha](https://github.com/Thorium-Sim/thorium/releases) and see the current [roadmap](https://github.com/Thorium-Sim/thorium/projects/2).
