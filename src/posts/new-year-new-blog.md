Hey Everybody!

I've revamped my blog, which hopefully means I'll be writing in here a little bit more. I also think that I'll be writing about more technical things in addition to my spiritual and self-improvement themed posts.

If you have any comments about the blog itself or about what I should write about, feel free to get in touch (you have about three or four different methods on the home page).

Cheers!
