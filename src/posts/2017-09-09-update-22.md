- Added a check to make sure the engine heat doesn't bog down the rest of the ship
- Did a major refactor by updating nearly all of the packages to the latest version. This required me to remove all 3D views, including the thrusters, main reactor, and the planetary scan. This will be added back in in a future release.
- Made it less likely for message groups to collide with Station names
- Widgets are now much more friendly, with drag and drop windows
- Sensor scans are handled better
- Scan presets can be invoked with `alt+{number}` keys on the core
- You can now destroy standard probes
- Added labels to the tractor beam and targeting screen
- Included more training for damage and security teams
