Who likes getting letters? I certainly do. There is nothing better than going to the mailbox and finding an envelope with your name carefully hand written across the front, opening it, and reading the words within, written specially for you.

Who wants to make someone happy? How about making someone happy every day for thirty days? That is my goal - I want to write a letter to a different person every day for thirty days.

I'm going to start this coming month. For the next few days, I'm going to compile a list of thirty people I will write to. I'll pick up a book of stamps. Come September first, I'll be writing. I'll catch up with the person, express gratitude, remind them of the good old times, and maybe even invite them to take the same challenge.

This is one way I know that I can make a small difference in someone's life. Or maybe a big difference. Who knows?

Cheers!
