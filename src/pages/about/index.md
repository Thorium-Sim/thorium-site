Thorium is a platform for rich simulated experiences, focusing mainly on starship simulators. Designed and engineered primarily by [Alex Anderson](https://ralexanderson.com), it's purpose is to provide the technology and functionality necessary for next-generation simulations. 

Thorium is currently under development. The progress can be found on the [Roadmap](https://github.com/Thorium-Sim/thorium/projects/2). Primary features will include:

* Multiple simulators in the same framework
* Multiple stations and cards
* Realtime data sharing across devices
* Physics Simulations
* Pre-recorded macros
* Timelines
* Hardware Panel Support
* Analytics and psychometrics
* And More

Thorium is approaching Alpha Testing. If you are interested in testing Thorium, [get in touch](mailto:thoriumsim@gmail.com).
